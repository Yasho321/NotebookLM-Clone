# 📓 Chithhi LM – NotebookLM Clone  

🚀 Live Demo: [notebook-lm-clone-one.vercel.app](https://notebook-lm-clone-one.vercel.app/)  

Chithhi LM is an AI-powered platform that lets you upload, organize, and interact with knowledge sources. It uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to let you chat with your documents, web pages, texts and structured data. Built with a modern stack (MERN + LangChain.js + Qdrant + OpenAI), it offers an experience similar to Google’s NotebookLM but fully open-source.

## ✨ Features  

-  **Multi-format Uploads** – Supports **PDF, DOCX, TXT, and CSV** files.  
-  **URL Scraping** – Fetch and process content directly from any webpage.  
-  **Automatic Title & Summary** – Each upload is summarized using AI.  
-  **Chat with Your Data** – Ask questions about your documents/web pages via RAG implementation.  
-  **Authentication** – Secure user access with JWT & bcrypt.  
-  **File Handling** – Handled using Multer, PDF Parser, and Docx/CSV parsing libraries.  
-  **AI-Powered** – Uses **LangChain.js, OpenAI SDK**, and **Qdrant Vector DB** for embeddings & retrieval.
